=================================
Mouse VISp
=================================

RNA sequencing data of single cells isolated from mouse primary visual cortex (VISp).
The data set includes 15413 single cells collected from various cortical layers.
The sequencing results were aligned to exons and introns in the GRCm38.p3 reference genome using the STAR algorithm, and aggregated counts at the gene level were calculated.
For more details, please see the Documentation tab in the Cell Types web application.
